project_title: AI Denoising to Accelerate Detector Simulation
project_goal: >
    Develop fast and accurate simulation of highly granular calorimeters using
    machine learning models.
    Use a 'denoising' approach to upscale existing physics-based fast
    simulation to achieve better quality at similar speeds.

  <b>2024 Q2 </b>
  <br>

  *   Progress
      *   Completed full data pipeline for training on CMS HGCal simulation.
      *   Trained first models to reproduce single photon HGCalEE showers in a limited energy range at fixed rapidity and angle. Captured basic structure of the shower but modeling of some features can be improved
      *   Developed first version of the model which uses existing fastsim as an input to reduce number of diffusion steps needed for high quality generation by using conditional distillation technique
  *   Next steps
      *   Generate a larger set of CMS HGCal simulations covering a larger phase space. Use these simulations to train the model at a larger scale.
      *   Improve the modeling of some HGCal shower features (energy per layer, radial spread of the shower, occupancy) 
      *   Develop testing suite to quantitatively validate performance of trained model
      *   Further optimize usage of existing fast sim input to improve speedup gains

  <b>2024 Q1 </b>
  <br>

  *   Progress
      *   Began development of pipeline for training on CMS HGCal simulation, including handling complicated geometry.
      *   Began development of hybrid model which incorporates existing fast simulation to reduce time needed for generation of high quality showers
  *   Next steps
      *   Complete HGCal simulation pipeline, train first models.
      *   Complete developement of hybrid model. Test speed up gains from its usage


  <b>2023 and prior </b>

  *   Progress
      *   Have successfully developed denoising diffusion model for calorimeter simulation that achieves state of the art results on public datasets.
      *   Paper published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.072014"> Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) </a>
  *   Next steps
      *   Next steps are to explore different methods of improving the generation speed, including diffusing from existing fast simulation rather than pure noise. 
      *   Following this, we will apply the model to simulate the current CMS calorimeter and eventually the HGCal design.

project_title: Automating algorithm loading and executing on GPUs for SONIC
project_goal: >
  Automating the process of loading and executing algorithms on GPUs is an essential aspect of the SONIC project. SONIC, short for Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors, aims to optimize computing resource utilization for large-scale data processing involving the use of ML and non-ML algorithms to identify and categorize reconstructed particles from collisions.

  - Progress Report
    - Learned to run SONIC miniAOD workflow at Purdue Tier2 cluster.
    - Learned to measure throughput and latency with the tools provided to measure miniAOD workflow for both GPU triton server and CPU direct inference, and interpret the performance.
    - Wrote a sonic producer for particle transformer for B-jet tagging in Run 3 miniAOD workflow. Tested its performance for both GPU triton server and CPU direct inference with CMSSW_14_1_0_pre0 and a 2023 TTbar MC sample. The sonic producer is integrated to CMSSW.
    - Wrote a sonic producer for unified particle trasnformer for B-jet tagging in Run 3 miniAOD workflow. The sonic producer is integrated to CMSSW.
    - Tutored a grad student to write a sonic producer for Machine Learning Particle Flow.
    - Learned to run custom backend for Patatrack-as-a-service and Line Segment Tracking. Both backends are for algorithms written in CUDA.
    - Start to develop a backend for Line Segment Tracking algorithm which switches to ALPAKA. 
    - Wrote a ALPAKA demo code and wrote a backend that allows it to be loaded on Triton Server.

  - Next Steps
    - Tutor a grad student to write a sonic producer for Global Particle Transformer.
    - Continue working on developing a backend for Line Segment Tracking algorithm, collaborating with postdoc and grad student from University of Florida.
    - Start to work on harmonizing direct inference interface and SONIC interface for Machine learning algorithms in CMSSW.
